# Contribute

One rule, two facts.

1. Don't be an ass.
1. Code is provided as-is, if you don't like something change it and contribute
   back
1. Taking time to contribute, while appreciated, does not equal an obligation on
   my end to accept the contribution.

## Code

To maximize your chances of having a contribution accepted, I have two simple
rules for code quality.

1. Your code needs to grow organically, in my mind I ask and question every
   single addition, I can answer each one of them for my code, can you answer
   for yours? If the answer is no, revisit.
2. Document your work. No, code is not self-documenting, it's self-evident. There's a wide
   margin of difference there, I can tell what the code is doing, but without
   your generous thoughts, I can't tell why the code is doing what it's doing.

> [!CAUTION]
> Prefix your thoughts with `NOTE(@yourgithubusername):` you'll see those
> everywhere in the code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't submit code with `TODO`s in it. Your contributions are a short-term
> commitment, I have to maintain the code. So your contributions should be
> self-sufficient, complete, and most importantly, comphrensive enough to meet
> your initial intent behind contributing.
